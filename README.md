# SEKANS-Bankruptcy-Contagion-Simulation-in-SME-Financial-Networks
In this project, we analyzed the financial network structure formed by credit-debt relationships among SMEs. By simulating how potential bankruptcies could spread throughout the system, we developed a model aimed at early detection of financial collapse risks and prediction of bankruptcy contagion.
